# Changelog

## 0.8.0

- Optional iPhone clipboard boost (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B19). New config
  `clipboardBoost` (default **false**) and an app-supplied `StraitClipboard` adapter
  (`hasProbableWebUrl`, `readText`; README shows a MethodChannel version). With it on, the
  once-per-install check on iOS asks without a prompt whether the clipboard holds a web URL,
  reads it only then (iOS shows its paste prompt), and claims a Strait handoff link via
  `POST /v1/handoff/claim` for an exact match (`LinkRoute.clipboard`), else falls back to the
  signal match. With it off (the default) the clipboard is never touched.
- New `claimHandoff(text)` for a paste button (no prompt).
- New core export `parseHandoffUrl` (conformance vectors v7).

## 0.7.2

- Privacy hardening (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B18): the URL sent with an open report
  (`/v1/open`, `/v1/resolve`) and saved in the offline queue (`strait.pendingOpens`) no
  longer carries the query string or fragment, except the first `utm_source` pair, which
  the engine uses for channel attribution. Reports queued by an older version are
  stripped the next time the queue is read. Your app's `LinkEvent` (`rawUrl`, `url`,
  `params`) is unchanged, and so is what the engine records.
- An expired remembered tap id (`strait.lastTap`, older than 7 days) is now deleted at
  `start()` and by `trackEvent`, instead of only being ignored.
- New core exports: `reportUrl`, `staleTap` (conformance vectors v6).

## 0.7.1

- Report the portrait screen width so a first launch in landscape still matches the tap
  (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B17): new core export `portraitScreenWidth(width, height)`
  (the shorter side, rounded like the browser; conformance vectors v5). Build
  `DeviceFields.screenWidth` with it, as the README now shows.

## 0.7.0

- Every attributed open now supplies the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B16):
  when `/v1/resolve` (verified short link), `/v1/match` (fingerprint) or
  `/v1/referrer` (Play install) returns `clickId`, it is remembered as
  `strait.lastTap` and sent with conversion events. A reply without one (older
  engine) keeps the 0.6.0 behaviour.
- New core export: `replyClickId` (conformance vectors v4).

## 0.6.0

- Conversion events carry the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B15): the tap id
  of the last attributed link open (browser hand-off `strait_click`, or the Play
  referrer on a deferred install) is remembered under `strait.lastTap` and sent as
  `clickId` with `trackEvent` for 7 days. A newer short-link or fingerprint open
  forgets it. `trackEvent(name, clickId: …)` overrides it.
- New core exports: `eventClickId`, `rememberTap`, `attributionWindowMs`
  (conformance vectors v3).

## 0.5.0

- **Breaking: renamed to Strait.** The package is now `strait_sdk`
  (`import 'package:strait_sdk/strait_sdk.dart';`). `BridgeLinks` →
  `StraitLinks`, `parseBridgeLink` → `parseStraitLink`, `parseBridgeClick` →
  `parseStraitClick`; `lib/src/bridge.dart` → `lib/src/strait.dart`.
- **Breaking (clean break, no aliases):** wire params are now `strait_click`
  and `strait_link` (Play Install Referrer and hand-off URLs); the old
  `bridge_*` names are no longer read. Storage keys are now `strait.*`
  (`strait.deferredChecked`, `strait.pendingOpens`); values saved under the
  old keys are ignored, so a deferred link may be checked once more after
  upgrading.
- Publishable keys are issued as `st_pub_live_…` / `st_pub_test_…`.

## 0.4.0

- **New (contract B14):** every link open is reported exactly once. Each open
  gets an id from `newOpenId` (`o_<base36 ms>_<12 chars>`), also used as the
  `LinkEvent.id`. Short links send `openId`, `appState`, `firstLaunch`, `at`
  with `/v1/resolve` (falling back to `/v1/open` when the engine didn't record
  it); custom-scheme hand-offs and your own https links are reported via
  `POST /v1/open` without delaying the event. Unsent reports are kept in
  `storage` under `bridge.pendingOpens` and retried on start, on resume and
  after any successful report (≤7 days, ≤100). New `pendingOpenReports()` and
  `flushOpenReports()`.
- **New (B4):** a `bridge_click` tap id is removed from the destination
  (`takeClickId`) and returned as `ClassifiedUrl.clickId`.
- **Changed (B6/B7/B8):** the deferred check is marked done only once the
  engine answered (no answer / 429 / 5xx → `reason: 'network'`, retried next
  launch). The once-per-install run sends `openId` + `at` on `/v1/referrer`
  and `/v1/match`, plus the tap id (`parseBridgeClick`) on `/v1/referrer`;
  `checkDeferred()` sends neither.
- **New pure helpers:** `parseBridgeClick`, `takeClickId`, `pruneOpenQueue`,
  `shouldRetryReport`, `newOpenId`, `openQueueMax`, `openQueueMaxAgeMs` —
  checked against conformance vectors v2.

### Packaging

- Publish-ready for pub.dev: homepage / repository / issue_tracker / topics,
  MIT `LICENSE`, an `example/`, and `.pubignore` so tests, fixtures and repo
  tooling don't ship. `dart pub publish --dry-run` reports 0 warnings.
- The package name and URLs come from `brand.json` (applied by
  `scripts/brand.mjs`), so the brand switch is one command.
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` → GitHub Actions runs analyze + tests and publishes via pub.dev
  automated publishing (OIDC, no stored secret). See PUBLISHING.md.

## 0.3.0

- **New:** `BridgeLinks` client — full parity with the React Native SDK
  (`shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md` B1–B13): direct links (verified App Links /
  Universal Links resolved via `POST /v1/resolve`, custom-scheme hand-offs),
  deferred links once per install (`bridge.deferredChecked`), `onLink` stream
  with replay, `onLinkStart` loading signal, app-state labels
  (closed/background/foreground), `checkDeferred`, `reportFingerprint`,
  `compareFingerprint`, `trackEvent`. Never throws; network failure →
  `matched: false, reason: 'network'`.
- **New:** pure helpers in `core.dart` — `browserScreenWidth`, `splitUrl`,
  `classifyUrl`, `AppStateTracker` — checked against
  `test/conformance-vectors.json`.
- **Fix:** `parseBridgeLink` now matches the contract exactly (first
  `bridge_link` pair wins; empty value → null). Moved to `core.dart`; still
  exported from the same places.
- `resolveDeferredLink` is unchanged and still supported.

## 0.2.0

- **Breaking:** `resolveDeferredLink` now takes `publishableKey` (your workspace
  publishable key, `bk_pub_live_…` / `bk_pub_test_…`, from Dashboard → Get started)
  instead of `appId`. Requests to `/v1/match` and `/v1/referrer` send
  `publishableKey` in the JSON body; the server rejects requests without it (401).

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: deferred deep-link resolution (Android Install Referrer,
  iOS/Android device-fingerprint match).
